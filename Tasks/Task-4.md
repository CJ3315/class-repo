# Markdown

As you created your personal page, you'll likely have noticed that there isn't any formatting â€”no bold, no italics, no way to change the text sizeâ€” it's all just plain, 'ol text.

Developers live in a world of plain text.  In keeping with this, all your notes and code should be written in nothing but plain text.  However, having formatted text can make it much easier to read and understand your notes, as well as helping you to find information later when you need it.

Markdown is a way to write in plain text, but you can also add simple symbols into the plain text which *can* be used add formatting.  For example, in markdown, to make a word bold you can wrap it with a pair of double asterisks or double underscores, to underline it you can wrap it in single asterisks or underlines.  Using this simple approach, you can very rapidly take and format notes without your fingers ever leaving the keyboard.

One minor challenge when using Markdown is that there are different variations, known as "flavors".  I strongly recommend that you limit yourself to the GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM).  

## Tutorials

So, before going any further, work through at least one of the following tutorials.

- Tutorials (remember, pay attention to, and take notes about, both the content *and* the instructional aspects)
  - [communicate-using-markdown](https://classroom.github.com/a/lWYv6-0u)
  - https://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/1/ 
  - https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/
    - As different flavors of markdown started to be created, the industry tried to standardize it into something called CommonMark.  Most of what works in CommonMark, _but not all_, will work in "GitHub Flavored Markdown", aka GFM.
