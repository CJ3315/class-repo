# Help and Collaboration

## ONGOING NOTE
If you have any questions about any task or assignment, post those questions in the team discussion area!

If you can answer, or even provide a bit of clarification for someone else's questions, provide that information!

## Getting Help

After this assignment, you'll be moving into the first "real" lessons of the course. Â You're bound to have questions, run into challenges, etc.

In the world of development, knowing when and how to ask questions is an absolutely critical skill!

When you need to ask a question, first reach out to your classmates via our GitHub Classroom's Discussion area.

If you don't get a timely answer from your classmates, then reach out to the UtahJS Slack group's "how-do-i-do-x" or "ask-and-learn" channels.

At some point, you'll start seeing references to StackOverflow.  Once you do, then include that among your resources.

I'm not trying to put you off. Â I *am* trying to help you learn how to interact with other developers.
Since seeking help may also leave you in limbo for a little while, _don't leave your assignments to the last minute!_

## "How to Ask Questions The Smart Way" Essay

You should skim most of "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" (linked below). Â If you're taking a 4000 or 6000 level college course, most of this should already be familiar.

For this course, completely skip and ignore the "Choose your forum carefully", "Stack Overflow", and "Web and IRC forums" sections. Â The first paragraph in "Almost to the nitty gritty" section (above) covers the appropriate forums and order that you should use them.

Make sure that you thoroughly read and follow the "Be precise and informative about your problem" section! Â This is where most beginner developers struggle the most. Â I've actually seen beginners struggle more with this than actual development. Â If you remember nothing else from this essay, remember this section!

Regarding the "RTFM and STFW: How To Tell You've Seriously Screwed Up" section â€”despite the essay authors' assertion, there are actually some more experienced developers who will be rude and demeaning. Â If you get one of these responses, you should ponder whether you've followed the other guidance related to asking a question. Â If you have, then just ignore the rude person!

## Rubber Duckies

Using the previous guidance, have a discussion with a rubber ducky. [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), [2](https://medium.com/@katiebrouwers/why-rubber-ducking-is-one-of-your-greatest-resources-as-a-developer-99ac0ee5b70a), [3](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)] ðŸ˜‰
There is absolutely no shame in working with a rubber ducky, whether that's a dog, another human, or simply writing down all the details to post a question, only to realize that you'd forgotten to account for something.


## Moral of this assignment

Do NOT be afraid to ask for help, or to provide assistance, just be wise in when and how you ask! ;-)
