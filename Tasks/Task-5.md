# Updating this repo

Between Tasks 1 through 4 you've already covered a lot of material.

From this point forward, you should be able to add what you're learning to this repo, while you're actually learning it.  Since you were actually learning how to do so this week, it wouldn't have been easy to add the notes as you went.  (e.g. adding an note and explication for `git add` when you don't understand the basics of `git` isn't a reasonable task).  

## Assignment 7

Once you've made it to this last task of the week, it's time to retroactively add anything that you've learned from this week to this repo.  I've provided some basic structure in a `References` section to get y'all started â€”***but this is your collective knowledge repo, so grow it, refine it, reorganize it in a way that will serve you and your classmates in the best way possible!***
