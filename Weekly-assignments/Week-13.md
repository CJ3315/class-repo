# Week 13 - Review

## Project Task

At this point, all projects should be complete.

1. Your task is to review your classmates' final projects
   - Ask questions about decisions that were made
   - Highlight aspects of their projects that you appreciate, either from a technical or instructional perspective
   - Make _polite and respectful_ comments about changes you think might be beneficial to their projects.
2. Rate your own project according to the appropriate course rubric.
   **_ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL NOTES_** 
   - Each student entered this course with different knowledge levels.
   - As you rate yourself, focus primarily on what **_you_** have demonstrated in your project.  Do _NOT_ compare yourself to everyone else in the class.
   - If you find it useful, you **_may_** —but do not have to— compare your project to other _comparable_ students' projects.
