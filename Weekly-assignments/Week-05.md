# Week 05 - RECOVER AND CATCH-UP WEEK

## Technical Tasks

Review the concepts that you identified as relevant to you potential projects last week, and redo any exercises related to those topics.

As a class, work together to clean-up and refine your existing notes in this repository, so that they're useful for you.


- Complete and repeat any remaining activities in the [FreeCodeCamp - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript) unit that you've found challenging (**_Not_** the ES6 sections and beyond)


- Complete [FreeCodeCamp - Learn HTML forms by building a registration form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#learn-html-forms-by-building-a-registration-form)
   - NOTE: There will be aspects of this course that were covered in previous courses that were _not_ required.  As needed, _you'll need to do some research and ask for help when you run into these things!_

### CSS Games

## Instructional Tasks

Post to the Discussion board what you liked, disliked, and what you would change about FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript instructional approach, its HTML/CSS instructional approach, and the Flexbox Froggy game.


## Project Task

Based on the various online instructional approaches that you've experienced (in this course or elsewhere), select 2 of your current project ideas and explain how you might use basic Html, CSS, and JavaScript to implement them.  This should not include any code, the goal is to start connecting the abstract material that we're covering with a possible implementation of your project.
