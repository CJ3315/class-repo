# Week 01 - GIT - SUPER CHALLENGING WEEK

## Technical Tasks

This is most likely the most challenging week of the course.  One of the tools that will be integral for subsequent work is _less than friendly_ for novices.  We'll only be using a small set of its functionality, and as we progress, it should make more and more sense, but the ramp up will be challenging for most of you.

Plan your time accordingly.
1. [Task 1](../Tasks/Task-1.md) should only take a few minutes
2. [Task 2](../Tasks/Task-2.md) includes
   - a long reading, but you only need to skim most of it
   - a simple pair of assignments
3. You will spend the vast majority of you time on [Task 3](../Tasks/Task-3.md).
   - There are 3 separate assignments for this task.
   - You may need to work through the first two assignments a few times.  ***Remember*** ask and answer questions in the discussion area!  If you find other resources that are helpful, post them in the discussion area for your classmates.
4. Once you've completed tasks 2-4, then [task 4](../Tasks/Task-4.md) should only take a few minutes.
5. [Task 5](../Tasks/Task-5.md) can take as long as you want it to, but the more you can concisely include at this point, the easier it will be to find this information moving forward.


## Instructional Tasks

In the Discussion thread on Instructional Pros and Cons, list elements of the previous tasks that you found beneficial and those that you didn't find beneficial.  For the non-beneficial aspects, feel free to suggest alternatives that you think would be be more beneficial.

Review you fellow classmates' comments, and add your feedback as appropriate.  
> We all have different perspectives and insights and _need_ to learn from each other!


## Project Task

This week focus on the Technical and Instructional tasks, but feel free to think about _simple_ instructional projects you are interested in pursuing.


## General note moving forward

This is _our_ course repo.  Anyone in the class may make a pull request (PR) to improve this repo and any other class member may approve someone else's PR.  This can be something as simple as correcting a typo, to creating entirely new directories and pages.

The one caveat to this, is that PRs for the `README.md`, `Weekly-assignments`, and `Tasks` directories may only be _approved_ by me; however, anyone may make PR for these files.  If you see a typo in one of these pages, or think you have a better way to explain a task, please submit a PR, if I concur with your suggestion I'm absolutely willing to approve such PRs!

> This is your classes' course repo.  Make it as informative and useful as possible for you and your classmates!
