# Week 02 - Basic HTML & Intro to JavaScript - CHALLENGING WEEK

## Technical Tasks

During this course, you'll be focusing on three different languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### HTML

Html is relatively easy.

### CSS

It's relatively easy to learn _enough_ CSS to be useful.
However, there's a lot that can be learned to do some amazing things.
You're only expected to use a minimal amount of CSS

### JavaScript

The basics of JavaScript aren't particularly challenging, _however_ there's a **_lot_** of basics in JavaScript!  There's no realistic way for you to learn all of the basics in the time available for this course.  
When you're trying to learn them quickly, it's also really easy to get really confused, really quickly.  
As you learn things, add them to this repo.  
Review what others have added, and â€”for your sanityâ€” don't try to do all the JavaScript activities during one or two marathons.
Do proportional chunks each day (e.g this week there are 8 JS exercises, only do one or two of them each day).

Use the HTML & CSS tasks as fun, palette cleansers. ðŸ˜‰

## Instructional Tasks

Post to the Discussion board what you liked, disliked, and what you would change about the Exercism's instructional approach and the FreeCodeCamp's instructional approach.


## Project Task

Think of at least 6 project topics you'd like to complete for the semester.  As you learn more, and I learn more about you, we'll whittle this down to  a single project.
