# Week 10 - Projects

Again, your project tasks will largely be dependent on your project's needs.  
I expect at least 2 things from you each week:

- to see the progress that you've made
- to have an updated task list, including the tasks you expect to complete in the next week

_In general_, you should have the vast majority of your JavaScript completed by the end of Week 10.  This includes the interactive elements of your project.

**_Remember to reach out to your classmates as needed!_**
**_And you may absolutely reach out to me more than once a week!_**

## Collaboration Task

Review your classmates' projects, let them know what you find really useful, if it appears that they're still struggling, make suggestions to help them correct or refine their code.
